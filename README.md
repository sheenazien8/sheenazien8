Open Source Addict!
<!--Iâ€™m currently working on [Frontline](https:\\frontline-app.com) as a Backend and litle bit to change Frontend, in here i use Laravel and Reactjs.-->

### More About Me :blush:
I am a seasoned software engineer with a strong foundation in backend development, specializing in the Laravel framework. My programming journey started in 2018, and since then, I have continuously evolved and expanded my skill set to encompass a wide range of technologies and tools.

In addition to Laravel, I have in-depth knowledge and experience in Go, Lua, and Dart/Flutter, allowing me to develop robust and scalable solutions across different platforms. My expertise extends to front-end development, where I am proficient in using Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap to create sleek and responsive user interfaces.

Furthermore, I am well-versed in JavaScript frameworks such as Next.js/React.js and Vue.js, enabling me to build dynamic and interactive web applications. My diverse skill set and hands-on experience in backend and frontend technologies empower me to tackle complex challenges and deliver high-quality software solutions.

Outside of coding, I am keen on exploring new technologies, staying updated with industry trends, and engaging in continuous learning to enhance my skills further. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and contribute positively to the software development community.
